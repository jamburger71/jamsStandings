# Jams Standings

This repository hosts the source code and ROBLOX place file in which the model can be tested. This project was created using the Rojo plugin for the IMRP racing league in ROBLOX and is not for distribution. It is designed to run alongside Wesley's Timing System 3, with future plans of an implementation for [Wesley's Timing System 4](https://github.com/Wesley1041/wes-timing-system-4).

## Coding
### Single Script Architecture
This model has been developed with a heavy influence from the existing [Wesley's Timing System 4](https://github.com/Wesley1041/wes-timing-system-4) and follows a similar modular design.

### Modularity
The scripts are set up so that each serve their own purpose and that it is easy to adjust the timing system to your needs.

### Abstractions
The logic is broken down in layers so that more detailed logic is not visible at first. You don't always need to know how a function works, just know how to use it and what it does.
